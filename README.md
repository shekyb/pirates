Hi,

Thanks for reviewing my app!
Below you will find instructions how to build and serve files in dev and production environment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo to your local machine and enter the folder

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shekyb/pirates.git
    cd pirates
    ```

2. Install the dependancies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Build files and run the server

    ```
    gulp serve
    ```

    If you would like to run production environment add `--production` flag

    ```
